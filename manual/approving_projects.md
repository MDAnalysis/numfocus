# Approving NumFOCUS Projects

There are two basic types of projects at NumFOCUS, Fiscally Sponsored and Affiliated:

- Fiscally Sponsored Projects are project that can readily receive funding and have a financial board.
- Affiliated Project are projects that are not funded (or seeking funding) but do contribute to the NumFOCUS mission.

Both types of projects can participate in many of the services and programs NumFOCUS offers. These include web hosting, small grants, invitation to summit, and such. A fiscally sponsored project can use services such as legal services from our legal team, financial reporting, and financial account management.

Because the expense and management of legal and financial services, we only invite projects to join our Fiscal Sponsorship program if they meet the high standards of our community and have practical need. Let's review the criteria and approval process.

## Criteria

Our general criteria for any project joining NumFOCUS are summarized in the following three rules:

1) Be scientifically oriented: The project is an active contributor to our mission to scientific research
2) Be open: The project must be led openly
3) Be kind: The project must be inclusive of all peoples.

These three rule help guide the board in accepting projects but there are many factors to consider for each. Ultimately the board works with the staff to understand if NumFOCUS can accept the risk and burden of supporting new projects. 

## Evaluation process

After an application has been received by the NumFOCUS Staff, the application is forwarded to the board. A board member will accept the responsibility of championing a project to evaluate the project according to our criteria. Write a report in an issue on the GitHub numfocus-board repository. Then propose a vote. See the voting procedures document in this repo. 

Because each criterion is somewhat vague, which is by design to allow for maximum flexibility in the boards decision, we provide some examples of how board members have interpreted the process. 

### Be Scientifically Oriented 

Is this project built by science for science or a general tool that scientists might use? For example Stencila and ReadTheDocs are two tools that are immensely important but failed our mission criteria. Both are general tools that are ultimately focused to a wider audience than the NumFOCUS community.

### Be Led Openly

Is the project a true open collaboration or a code based on a few people's good work? A good rule of thumb is the number of committers who have made more than, say, 50 commits. If the number of core contributors is less than 5, the project is still susceptible to "rule by the few" and will not truly be led openly. This rule has been relaxed for Affiliated projects to allow into the program projects that are still growing; but such projects need to show that they have made significant effort to expand their developer community.

Does the project allow contributions from the open community? Many open source projects are not led openly but rather walled gardens that is controlled by a few private interests. One commonly cited example is the TensorFlow project. While it is open source, only code that is approved by Google will be considered. Since NumFOCUS is a 501(c)3 in the interest of public good, it is our opinion that we cannot support such projects. While they may be good for the public good, it is too unclear whether private or public interests are the primary concern.

Does the project have governance documentation? While this has not always been a requirement, the project needs to be able to say how technical, legal, and financial decisions are made. As part of the project agreement the legal and financial decision makers will need to sign on behalf of the project. Those signatories need to be independent individuals, i.e. independent of family or business relationships. There is currently no formal documentation structure for governance.

Does the project use an OSI approved license? If not why? Does the project depend on a proprietary runtime? For example, while we respect the amazing work of the Matlab team, we don't accept codes that only run on Matlab, because it doesn't promote the openness of code for science and limits the people able to use the code.


### Be kind

Is the project welcoming of the open code community? Does it have documentation and communication channels open to the public? Does it have a reputation for helping new users or shunning them?

Does the project have a code of conduct (CoC) that encourages diversity and inclusion? The CoC requirement doesn't require a specific form. We want to make sure it is prominently linked on the projects web site or code repository. 

Does the project have a committee for conduct violations, or will they want NumFOCUS to adjudicate?
